TODO:
1. Work on '/Users/kerenlasker/projects/opto/microscopy/scripts/data/cell_outline2.txt', this is a hard one. mesh does not look as great, need to further extend the skeleton.
2. 


Where we are?
cell2 does not work. I think it has to do with indexes. Check that.
build a benchmark of cells to test the program on.
I am moving to modeling for a bit. I should make a figure on the cells.
